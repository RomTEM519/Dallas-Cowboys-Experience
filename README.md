# My First Front-End Website

This project is my first full front-end website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It was created for my high-school web development class, where I focused on learning core JS concepts and improving the site through iterative design.

## Features
- Fully custom layout and styling
- Multiple interactive elements written in vanilla JS
- Responsive design for different screen sizes **phone,tablet,desktop** 

## Process and Documentation
I recorded my full iterative design process and conducted UX testing with 5 users.  
Both the **SuperFan Iterative Process Slides.** and **UX testing report** are included as PDFs in this repository.
